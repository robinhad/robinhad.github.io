## About Me

Hello! I'm Yura Paniv, a PhD student in Computer Science at the Ukrainian Catholic University (UCU).

I'm passionate about machine learning, particularly in the areas of natural language processing and speech technologies. My research focuses on efficient model training with limited data, especially for multimodal models.

## Research Interests

My PhD proposal is titled "Unsupervised Data Validation Training For Efficient Model Training". I'm working on developing methods to obtain high-quality machine learning models using minimal data, with a focus on multimodal models.

## Notable Projects

1. **Ukrainian TTS (Text-to-Speech)**
   - A multi-voice Text-To-Speech system with stress selection and auto-stress features
   - [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/robinhad/ukrainian-tts)

2. **Kruk**
   - Fine-tuning LLM models for Ukrainian language understanding
   - [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/robinhad/kruk)

3. **Ukrainian STT (Speech-to-Text)**
   - Experimented with DeepSpeech and wav2vec for offline Ukrainian speech recognition
   - [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/robinhad/voice-recognition-ua)

4. **Crimean Tatar TTS**
   - Developed the world's first public Crimean Tatar text-to-speech model
   - Achieved a quality model from just 3 hours of audio data
   - [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/robinhad/qirimtatar-tts)

## Research Journey

I'll be documenting my PhD research journey on this site, sharing day-to-day and week-to-week updates on my progress, challenges, and discoveries in the field of Computer Science at UCU.

Stay tuned for regular updates on my research and projects!
