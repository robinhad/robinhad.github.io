I was one of the authors and lecturers for GenAI course at Ukrainian Catholic University in Fall 2024. Alongside my colleagues Nazarii Druschak and Igor Babin we introduced students to generative NLP and CV concepts, tools and latest research. Course syllabus is available [here](https://apps.ucu.edu.ua/en/data-science/curriculum/generative-ai/).
