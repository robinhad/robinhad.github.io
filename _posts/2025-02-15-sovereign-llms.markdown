I was a PM for this policy research paper. This report analyzes key trends, challenges, risks, and opportunities associated with the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) globally. It examines national experiences in developing LLMs and assesses the feasibility of investment in this sector. Additionally, the report explores strategies for implementing, regulating, and financing AI projects at the state level. We analyzed more than 18 macroregions, covering about 85% of the worldâ€™s population.
